## Avoid Barrel File Imports

Import directly from source files instead of barrel files to avoid loading thousands of unused modules. Barrel files are entry points that re-export multiple modules.

Popular icon and component libraries can have up to 10,000 re-exports. For many React packages, it takes 200-800ms just to import them, affecting both development speed and production cold starts.

**Incorrect (imports entire library):**

```tsx
import { Check, X, Menu } from 'lucide-react'
// Loads 1,583 modules, takes ~2.8s extra in dev

import { Button, TextField } from '@mui/material'
// Loads 2,225 modules, takes ~4.2s extra in dev
```

**Correct — Direct imports (non-Next.js / Vite projects):**

```tsx
import Button from '@mui/material/Button'
import TextField from '@mui/material/TextField'
// Loads only what you use
```

> **TypeScript warning:** Some libraries (notably `lucide-react`) don't ship `.d.ts` files for their deep import paths. Importing from `lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/check` resolves to an implicit `any` type, causing errors under `strict` or `noImplicitAny`. Vite users can use `vite-plugin-optimize-barrel` or verify the library exports types for its subpaths before using direct imports.

Libraries commonly affected: `lucide-react`, `@mui/material`, `@tabler/icons-react`, `react-icons`, `@headlessui/react`, `@radix-ui/react-*`, `lodash`, `ramda`, `date-fns`, `rxjs`, `react-use`.
